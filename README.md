# GSU-RDS-certification-practice-Python-2
This is code that I worked on during the Research Data Services Certification workshops hosted by Georgia State University. During this workshop, we practiced learning the basics of data analysis in Python, and R. I have included this to show an understanding of basic concepts. I did not create this notebook- I only added to it.
